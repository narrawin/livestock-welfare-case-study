# Livestock welfare case study - supporting files

These files are part of a project exploring the use of public datasets to inform decision processes around livestock welfare in extensive livestock systems in Australia. 

The content of this repo are:
- QGIS project file
- MS Excel spreadsheet with list of datasets used in the project and other related info

The spreadsheet contains multiple tabs containing:
**Welfare layers:** grouped by welfare elements, these are the GIS datasets that were found during the dataset search, showing name, scope, spatial and temporal information, source and URL and other notes. Datasets included in the QGIS project file are indicated.

**Conditions:** a complete listing of all diseases, parasites and deficiences that affect cattle, and the factors that were used to decide whether to include them in the search. Also shown are the results of each search, relations between factors, and information sources.

**Catalogues:** a listing of names and URLs of data catalogues used in the search.

**Sources:** a listing of sources used to determine cattle diseases, parasites and deficiencies.

**Supporting layers:** Additional datasets that may be useful for a livestock welfare portal.

**Portals:** Geospatial portals that were identified during the dataset search, which may be useful to link to in a livestock welfare portal. Grouped by welfare elements, full names and URLs and maintainers are shown. Some portals allow access to datasets, which is indicated.

**Other useful collections:** These are some additional sources of potentially useful datasets that were found during the search.

**Other info:** Another selection of datasets specific to cattle in Australia which may be useful.

---------------------

Note that the QGIS project file contains layers that were sourced from downloaded datasets, which are not included, therefore the project file won't work unless those local files are obtained and the path is updated in the project file. This project file is intended only as a backup.
